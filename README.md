# MiniKey

This is a 3D-printable case designed for the ESP32-S3 SuperMini development board, intended to transform it into a robust and portable FIDO2 hardware security key.

This case requires the pico-fido2 firmware, available from the author's open-source repository at: [polhenarejos/pico-fido2](https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido2)

Key Features:

Custom-Fit: Perfectly tailored for the ESP32-S3 SuperMini board and fully compatible with the pico-fido2 project.

Full Protection: The full-enclosure design effectively shields the circuit board from daily bumps and damage.

Precise Cutouts: Features precise openings for the USB-C port and function buttons, ensuring easy access and operation.

Ready to Print: The repository includes an optimized .STL file, ready for immediate 3D printing.

Additional Notes:

For a more permanent and secure assembly, it is recommended to use a small amount of AB glue (epoxy resin) to bond the case together. Be careful to avoid getting glue on the buttons or the USB-C port.
