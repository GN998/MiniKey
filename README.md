# ESP32-S3-SuperMini-FIDO2-Case
A 3D printable case designed specifically for the ESP32-S3 SuperMini development board, which aims to turn it into a portable and durable hardware FIDO2 security key.

This design perfectly fits the pico-fido2 project, providing full protection and leaving cutouts for the USB-C port and all necessary button holes. The repository includes the .STL file, ready for direct 3D printing.
